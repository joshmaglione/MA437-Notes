\section{Introduction}

The mathematics of decision making is very closely tied to the field of
mathematical optimization. One of the primary ways mathematics is used to help
guide decisions is by maximizing (or minimizing) specific outcomes subject to a
list of constraints. Mathematical optimization provides the formal tools to
model and solve such problems.

There are many kinds of mathematical optimization. There are two basic types
depending on whether the variables to optimize or discrete or continuous. A few
types of optimization are\footnote{``Program'' is not a computer program but
comes from the United States military's use of the word for training and
logistics schedules.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Linear Programming,
	\item Integer Programming,
	\item Stochastic programming,
	\item Combinatorial optimization,
	\item Dynamic programming.
\end{itemize}
Unsurprisingly there are many real-world applications; to list a few we have
network optimization, pricing strategy, scheduling, supervised machine learning
training, supply chain optimization, and transportation problems. 

In this module, we will introduce the fundamentals of \textbf{linear
programming}, also called \emph{linear optimization} and \emph{operations
research}, such as the simplex method, polyhedral geometry, and the notion of
duality. Depending on the time, we may also delve into \textbf{integer
programming}.

\subsection{History}

Mathematical optimization has quite an interesting history. In the 17th century,
combinatorial optimization problems were solved using game theory,
combinatorics, and ad hoc methods. In the 19th century, transportation problems
involving post and rail were studied and solved. And in the 20th century with
the two World Wars and rise of the assembly line, operations research took off
developing the mathematics for all kinds of optimization problems. 

One of the most influential figures in mathematical optimization, and linear
programming in particular, is George Dantzig. He was the recipient of the
President's National Medal of Science in 1975 \cite{NSF} and was credited for 
\begin{quote}
	\emph{inventing linear programming and discovering methods that led to wide-scale scientific and technical applications to important problems in logistics, scheduling, and network optimization, and to the use of computers in making efficient use of the mathematical theory.}
\end{quote}
The proof of the simplex method, name coined by Motskin, was developed by
Dantzig in the late 1940s~\cite{Dantzig}. I find it interesting that the
``inductive proof of the simplex method'' was published by the Mathematics
Division of the RAND Corporation in 1960 (by Dantzig) and was made
classified~\cite{SimplexMethod}. Now, of course, it is no longer classified.

After explaining the Simplex Method to John von Neumann at the Institute of
Advanced Study in Princeton during 1948, von Neumann immediately conjectured the
notion of duality because of his recent foray into game theory. 

\subsection{Five examples}

We describe five example problems that touch on the tools we will develop in
this module. For now, these problems are meant to introduce basic concepts and
vocabulary.

\subsubsection{A diet problem}

Erin is planning her breakfast and wants to make oats with milk. (These
numbers of simplified and not accurate to real life.)
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|} \hline
		& Milk (100ml) & Oats (100g) \\ \hline 
		fat & 2g & 3g \\ 
		carbohydrates & 1g & 3g \\
		protein & 4g & 3g \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Erin wants the meal to provide at least 18g of fat, at least 12g of
carbohydrates, and at least 24g of protein. If milk costs 20 cents per 100ml and
oats 25 cents per 100g, what mixture minimizes the cost of the desired meal?


\subsubsection{A transportation problem}

Javier has two production sites: one in Sligo and another in Kilkenny. There are
three distributing warehouses in Dublin, Galway, and Cork. The Sligo site can
supply 120 products per week, whereas the site in Kilkenny can supply 140 per
week. The warehouses in Dublin, Galway, and Cork need 100, 60, and 80 products
per week respectively to meet demand. The shipping costs are giving in the
following table.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|} \hline 
		& Dublin & Galway & Cork \\ \hline 
		Sligo & 5 & 7 & 9 \\ 
		Kilkenny & 6 & 7 & 10 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

How many products should Javier ship from each production site to minimize total
shipping costs while still meeting demand?


\subsubsection{The travelling salesperson problem}

Kofi need to deliver $n$ products in $n$ different cities starting in Paris. He
wants to do this by visiting each city exactly one time and then returning back
to Paris at the end. Which path minimizes the distance traveled? 

This problem is perhaps the most famous combinatorial optimization problem and
is the core problem of many other more complex problems.

\subsubsection{A financial problem}

Julia runs an investment and must invest exactly \EUR 100,000 in two types of
securities: bond \textsf{A} paying a dividend of 7\% and stock \textsf{B} paying
a dividend of 9\%. Due to her incredible experience, she knows that 
\begin{itemize}
	\item no more than \EUR 40,000 can be invested in stock \textsf{B} and
	\item the amount invested in bond \textsf{A} must be at least twice that in
	stock \textsf{B}.
\end{itemize}
How much should Julia invest in each security to maximize her return?


\section{General linear programming}

Linear programs are the basis of what we consider throughout this module. In the
example problems above, we sometimes wanted to maximize and sometimes we wanted
to minimize. Although these are technically different, we can treat them as the
same. Suppose $f$ is some function we want to maximize. Then 
\[ 
	\max(f) = \min(-f).
\] 
So maximizing $f$ is the same as minimizing $-f$. Thus, we can use the two
interchangeably---as long as we correctly compensate!

\begin{mybox}[General linear program]
	Determine values for $x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n$ that maximize 
	\[
		z = c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \cdots c_n x_n 
	\]
	subject to the constraints:
	\begin{align*}
		a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n ~&\square~ b_1, \\
		a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \cdots + a_{2n}x_n ~&\square~ b_2, \\
		\vdots \qquad\quad \vdots \qquad\quad \vdots \qquad\quad \vdots \quad ~&\square~ \; \vdots \\
		a_{n1}x_1 + a_{n2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{nn}x_n ~&\square~ b_n,
	\end{align*}
	where each of the $\square$ can be replaced with one of $\{=,\leq,\geq\}$.
\end{mybox}

\begin{defn}
	A \define{linear program (LP) problem} is a problem of the form above. The
	function $z$ is called the \define{objective function}, and the $n$
	(in-)equalities are called the \define{constraints}.
\end{defn}

A key feature of LPs is that the objective function as well as each of the
constraint (in-)equalities are \emph{linear} in the $x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n$.
